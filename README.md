# Data-Structures-Algorithms
Coursework from SYDE 223.

Data structures and Algorithm projects. Written in C++

## Lab 3 
Priority Queue structured using a max heap/ Binary Search Tree implementation
Notable Algorithm Designs:
* Implement remove node algorithm for binary search tree
* implement enque/deque functionality for a max heap

## Practice Activity #2
Design  and  implement  a  recursive  function  named find_and_print_sum_of_nodesthat  finds  and  prints  all downwards paths in a given binary tree that sum up to a given value.The paths can start at any node, but do notspan both subtrees at that node. The tree is a general binary tree; it is not a heap, BST, or AVL tr

## Graph Practice
Implementations of Graphs using C++. Graph traversal using Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm
